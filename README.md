# Chatbot Features Documentation

Welcome to the Chatbot Features Documentation! Here, we‚Äôll walk you through the amazing features of your coding assistant. Ever faced a coding challenge and wished you had a helping hand? Well, this chatbot is here to save the day! Let‚Äôs dive into what it can do for you.

---

## 1. *Open the Chatbot*
   - *Ever felt stuck while coding and needed instant help?*  
     Simply open the chatbot! It‚Äôs your go-to assistant for all things coding. Whether you‚Äôre debugging, writing new code, or just need a second pair of eyes, the chatbot is ready to help.

---

## 2. *Name the Selected Function*
   - *Working on a large codebase and lost track of which function you‚Äôre editing?*  
     Use the "Name the selected function" feature! It quickly identifies and names the function you‚Äôre working on, so you can stay focused and organized.

---

## 3. *Toggle Auto Suggestions*
   - *Tired of typing out long lines of code or forgetting syntax?*  
     Turn on *Auto Suggestions*! The chatbot will provide real-time suggestions as you type, making coding faster and less error-prone. And if you ever find it distracting, just toggle it off with a single command.

## 4. *Generate Test Cases for This Code*
   - *Ever written a function and wondered if it works for all possible scenarios?*  
     Let the chatbot handle it! With the "Generate test cases" feature, it automatically creates test cases for your code. Whether it‚Äôs edge cases, normal inputs, or error handling, the chatbot ensures your code is robust and reliable.

---

## 5. *Review the Selected Code*
   - *Worried your code might have hidden bugs or inefficiencies?*  
     Get a second opinion! The chatbot can review your code and highlight potential issues, suggest improvements, and even point out best practices. It‚Äôs like having a code reviewer available 24/7.

---

## 6. *Add a Comment to Selected Code*
   - *Ever looked at your own code weeks later and thought, ‚ÄúWhat was I thinking?‚Äù*  
     Avoid the confusion! Use the "Add a comment" feature to automatically document your code. The chatbot will insert clear, concise comments that explain what your code does, making it easier for you (and others) to understand later.

---

## 7. *Analyze Time Complexity*
   - *Ever wondered if your code will slow down with larger inputs?*  
     The chatbot can analyze the time complexity of your code and tell you how it performs as the input size grows. Whether it‚Äôs O(n), O(n¬≤), or something else, you‚Äôll know exactly how efficient your code is.

---

## 8. *Other Commands*
   - *Need more than just code help?*  
     The chatbot has even more tricks up its sleeve! From refactoring code to managing dependencies, explore the "Other commands" to unlock its full potential. It‚Äôs designed to make your coding life easier and more productive.
